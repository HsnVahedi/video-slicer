## Free Video Slicer

It's up and running at freevideoslicer.com

It's for those who want to get several slices out of a large video all at once.

It uses [ffmpeg webassembly](https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm) to slice the videos

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
